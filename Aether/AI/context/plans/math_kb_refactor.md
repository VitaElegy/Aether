# Math KB Database Refactor & Bug Fix Plan
> Initiated: 2026-01-14
> Status: Deep Inquiry Phase

## Context
Refactoring the Math Knowledge Base to resolve rendering issues, improve data structure, and fix persistent bugs. This plan is being developed through a detailed Q&A session with the user.

## Core Objectives
1.  **Database Refactor**: Redesign schema to support interactive nodes better.
2.  **Bug Fixes**: Identify and resolve logical/rendering bugs.
3.  **Feature Polish**: Ensure the "Interactive" promise is met.

## Q&A Log
(Answers will be recorded here)

### Session 3: Detailed Interactions
8.  **Editor UI**: **Side Toolbar (Aesthetic)**. Non-intrusive.
9.  **Formula Input**: **Visual GUI** (Button-based).
10. **Visual Layout**: **Knowledge-Point First** (User Rejected Linear Scroll). 
    *   Goal: Display pure knowledge points (from `AI/tmp/`).
    *   Requirement: Visualization and Standardization of these points is primary. Article text is secondary.
